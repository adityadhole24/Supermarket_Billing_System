Designed and developed a Java-based Desktop Application for billing systems used in supermarkets. Used a MySQL database to store and retrieve customer/product information and Swings API for the front-end.
Created two interfaces - 

1) Customer - This interface resembles the one that is commonly found at the checkout counters of most supermarkets. The primary functionality here is generating customer invoices 
and simulatenous updation of inventory details at the backend.

2) Admin - This login option is intended for use by store administrators who wish to keep track of their store inventory. Options provided to the admin include adding new products to the 
store database, modifying their quantity or selling price, viewing all/any orders that have been processed, and viewing customer details.

The application is OS-independent due to the platform-neutral nature of Java.
